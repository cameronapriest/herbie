# Mars Rover - Herbie

Herbie is a Mars Rover built from JPL's open source rover (OSR). I'm currently working on implementing an autonomous person following algorithm so Herbie can follow someone around based on a color worn by the person. I've used the Intel L515 Lidar Camera to allow Herbie to avoid obstacles in its path.
